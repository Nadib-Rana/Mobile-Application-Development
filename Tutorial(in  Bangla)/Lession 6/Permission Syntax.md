Here are the summarized steps for handling permissions in an Android app using the EasyPermissions library:

1. **Add Dependency**: Include the EasyPermissions library in your `build.gradle` file.

2. **Override Permission Handling**: Create methods to request permissions and handle their results.

3. **Declare Permissions**: Specify the required permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`.

4. **Define Unique Request Codes**: Create constants for each permission request code.

5. **Handle Permissions Flow in onCreate**: Check for permissions and request them in the `onCreate` method.

6. **Trigger Actions on Permission Granted**: Create a function that executes specific actions when permissions are granted.

These steps will help you effectively manage permissions in your Android application.
