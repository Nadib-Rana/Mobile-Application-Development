# Sensor 
Sensors are devices that detect and measure physical phenomena and convert them into data for analysis. They are broadly categorized based on what they measure or their application. Here are the 
**3 major categories of sensors**:
---

### 1. **Motion Sensors**  
   - Detect movement, speed, or acceleration.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - Accelerometer  
     - Gyroscope  
     - Gravity 

### 2. **Environmental Sensors**  
   - Measure environmental factors like temperature, humidity, or pressure.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - Temperature Sensor  
     - Humidity Sensor  
     - Barometer  
     - Gas Sensor 

### 3. **Position**    
   - **Examples**:  
     - Magnetometer (compass)  
     - Proximity
