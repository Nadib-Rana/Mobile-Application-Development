# Sensor 
Sensors are devices that detect and measure physical phenomena and convert them into data for analysis. They are broadly categorized based on what they measure or their application. Here are the 
**3 major categories of sensors**:
---

### 1. **Motion Sensors**  
   - Detect movement, speed, or acceleration.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - Accelerometer  
     - Gyroscope  
     - Gravity 

### 2. **Environmental Sensors**  
   - Measure environmental factors like temperature, humidity, or pressure.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - Temperature Sensor  
     - Humidity Sensor  
     - Barometer  
     - Gas Sensor 

### 3. **Position**    
   - **Examples**:  
     - Magnetometer (compass)  
     - Proximity

**hardware** and **software sensors**:  

### **Hardware Sensors**  
- **Physical components** in a device that directly measure real-world data.  
- Example: Accelerometer (measures motion), Gyroscope (measures rotation), Proximity Sensor (detects nearby objects).  
- Found inside the device and interact with the environment.  

### **Software Sensors**  
- **Virtual sensors** created by combining or processing data from hardware sensors using software.  
- Example: Orientation Sensor (combines accelerometer and gyroscope), Step Counter (uses accelerometer data).  
- They donâ€™t physically exist but mimic functionality.  

In short:  
- **Hardware sensors** = Actual device parts.  
- **Software sensors** = Virtual, rely on hardware data and algorithms.
